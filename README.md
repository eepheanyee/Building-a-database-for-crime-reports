Building a database for crime reports

I've been learning about postgres recently and in this project, I just want to put everything together to build a database for storing data related to crimes that occurred in Boston. This dataset is available in the file boston.csv.

The goal of this project is to create a database named crimes_db with a table – boston_crimes – with appropriate datatypes for storing the data from the boston.csv file. I will be creating the table inside a schema named crimes. I will also create the readonly and readwrite groups with the appropriate privileges. Finally, I will also need to create one user for each of these groups.
